# R-Retail-Grocery-Sales-Analysis
This dataset is related to supermart retail grocery sales. The dataset has data on orders placed by customers on a grocery delivery application. I want to evaluate the supermarket's performance over several years. To do this, I'll analyze the number of orders per year and month, visualize the data, and compare it to the same months across different years.

I have included some of my visualization results here.
